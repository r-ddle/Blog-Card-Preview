## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

To contain a text inside a box and have the background properly fixed you need to remove the default header margin!

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

Should add some nice effects to make it look even better
